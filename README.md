# HackerrankPython
Advanced Data Mining 2022/2023 -  Homework 1


## Content : 


The repository contains:


  **a pdf file with the snippets of every submission page grouped by challenge in my hackerrank account
  
  
  **a .py file with the codes of every exercise of the first homework, every exercise is labelled with the commented title, I left the deafult comments placed by hackerrank. I checked online some clues for some regex, XML and HTML parser exercises. I  mistakenly wrote the solutions of the first exercises in PyPy3, but the code still works in Python3.
